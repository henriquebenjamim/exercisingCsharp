            //From Wikipedia,
            //In geometry, a polygon is a plane figure that is described by a finite number of straight line segments connected to form a closed polygonal chain or polygonal circuit.
            //The solid plane region, the bounding circuit, or the two together, may be called a Polygon.
            //Sample Output:
            //Input number of straight lines of the polygon:
            //Sum of the interior angles(in degrees) of the said polygon: -360
