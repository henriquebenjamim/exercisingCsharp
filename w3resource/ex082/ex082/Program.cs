            //A letter is a segmental symbol of a phonemic writing system. The inventory of all letters forms the alphabet.
            //Letters broadly correspond to phonemes in the spoken form of the language, although there is rarely a consistent, exact correspondence between letters and phonemes

            //Orginal string: Py @th12on
            //Remove all characters from the said string which are non-letters: Python
            //Orginal string: Python 3.0
            //Remove all characters from the said string which are non-letters: Python
            //Orginal string: 2 ^ sdfds * ^*^jlljdslfnoswje34u230sdfds984
            //Remove all characters from the said string which are non-letters: sdfdsjlljdslfnoswjeusdfds
